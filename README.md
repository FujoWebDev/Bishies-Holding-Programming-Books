* Add your images to the folder that best describes the subject matter of the book that the girl is holding. If no existing folder applies, create a new one. The simpler the name, the better;

* All characters must be "[Bishounens](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen)", in the English fandom connotation: "a really, really attractive male".
  But remember: attractiveness is in the eye of the beholder. Sometimes, so is maleness.
